# affective-agent-testing-tool

This project was a part of my master's thesis at TUDelft. The paper can be found in the [TUDelft repository](http://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid%3A1f8746a4-2f90-48ce-ab6f-e19fe143a95d/). 

This is a [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application and in order to run it you must follow the steps described in the [installation documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/) to set up a virtualenv. Once that has been initialized you can run the application by writing `python run.py` which should make the site accessible through localhost. 

At the time of writing, 10.01.2016, I have only made the initial commit to this repository. I plan on making more detailed documentation for the application and how to extend it along with carrying out some refactoring tasks.
